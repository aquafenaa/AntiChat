# Background
I made this mod for my own personal modpack, [Isolated Innovations](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/isolated-innovations), in order to disable global chat, and encourage players to create other forms of communication. If that's something that interests you, feel free to join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/u3RFFY2ZcT)

# Effects
When trying to send a chat message, the message is never sent to the server, and a message is sent to the player indicating that they cannot chat.

This mod also disables /msg, /w, and /me, /say, and other similar commands in order to stop players from getting around the "filter"

*Please note, however, that this mod only limits players ability to chat natively, meaning any other player may still send chat messages for all other players to see if they do not have the mod installed.*

# Usage
You can use this mod for whatever you want. Take it in its entirety, modify it, publish it... I don't mind! If you do, however, please let me know, purely because I am interested :)
